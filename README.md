## Project Overview

This is a simple prototype racing game with full control of vertical motion. This was the first real prototype I developed and is a tad rough around the edges. It was created around 2011-2012. 

## Installation

The project is updated to Unity 5.5.1f1 and can be run from that version. 

## Implementation

The thrusters on the craft apply forces to move the craft, all thrusters are where they appear to be. The application for the thrust was manual, very little adjustments are made on the raw input. There is additional code used to allow the craft to hover, but it has to be adjusted manually and is very fiddly. 

## Project Problems

Overall this project was a little too ambitious for my first prototype. The project ground to a halt as I tried to smooth out craft motion using a dynamic air resistance system (see Drag_Calculations script for partial implementation). As university started I had to shelve this project and it has been largely untouched since then.
